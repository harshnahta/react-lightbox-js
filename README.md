```jsx
import React, { Component } from 'react'

import { ReactLightbox } from 'react-lightbox-js'
import 'react-lightbox-js/dist/index.css'

const imagesArr=[{src:'1.png'},{src:'2.png'}]

class Example extends Component {
  constructor() {
      super();
      this.state = {
        isOpen: true,
      };
  }
  onClose = ()=>{
    // called when onClose method triggers i.e. when modal is closed
    setState({isOpen:false})
  }
  render() {
    return <ReactLightbox
              images={imagesArr}
              imageSrcKey={'src'}
              imageAltKey={'src'}
              onClose={onClose}
              isOpen={this.state.isOpen}
            />
  }
}
```

|  `imageAltKey` |  `string`  | 'src'  | image alt key |
|  `isOpen` |  `boolean`  | true  | open or hide modal. Modal will be opened if this prop is true and to hidemodal update this prop to false |

#### Example first: images having keys in array

```js
class Example extends Component {
  constructor() {
      super();
      this.state = {
        isOpen: true,
      };
    }
  onClose = ()=>{
    // called when onClose method triggers i.e. when modal is closed
    setState({isOpen:false})
  }
  render() {
    return <ReactLightbox
              sliderIndex = {0}
              images = {[{src:'1.png'},{src:'2.png'}]}
              imageSrcKey = {'src'}
              imageAltKey = {'src'}
              isOpen = {this.state.isOpen}
              onClose = {onClose}
              isZoom = {true}
              defaultZoom = {false}
              isEnlarge = {true}
              defaultFullScreen = {false}
              zoomValues = {['1', '1.5', '2', '2.5']}
              slideAnimationDuration = {'600ms'}
              overlayBackgroundColor = {'rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5)'}
              imageBackgroundColor = {'rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.9)'}
              objectFit = {`fill`}
            />
  }
}

```

#### Example two: images having simple array

```js
class Example extends Component {
  constructor() {
      super();
      this.state = {
        isOpen: true,
      };
    }
  onClose = ()=>{
    // called when onClose method triggers i.e. when modal is closed
    setState({isOpen:false})
  }
  render() {
    return <ReactLightbox
              sliderIndex = {0}
              images = {['1.png','2.png']}
              imageSrcKey = {''}
              imageAltKey = {''}
              isOpen = {this.state.isOpen}
              onClose = {onClose}
              isZoom = {true}
              defaultZoom = {false}
              isEnlarge = {true}
              defaultFullScreen = {false}
              zoomValues = {['1', '1.5', '2', '2.5']}
              slideAnimationDuration = {'600ms'}
              overlayBackgroundColor = {'rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5)'}
              imageBackgroundColor = {'rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.9)'}
              objectFit = {`fill`}
            />
  }
}
